QUERY_EXPANSION_PROMPT = """
Expand the query "{query}" into exactly {n} concise, high-signal variants. Also propose a short list of context terms.

**Query Context:**
- Field: "{field_name}"
- Tissue: "{tissue}"
- Organism: "{organism}"
- Derived Context Terms: {context_terms}

**Expansion Rules for Field "{field_name}":**
- Semantic Constraints: {semantic_constraints}
- Expansion Focus: {expansion_focus}
- Context Priority: {context_priority}
- Avoid: {avoid}
- Preserve core query tokens; if an abbreviation is present (e.g., "smg"), expand it (e.g., "submucosal gland").
- Reflect the Tissue and Organism context in the variants when applicable (e.g., lung/airway/bronchial for lung datasets).
- Do not cross organs or systems unless explicitly asked (avoid salivary/mammary/pancreatic for lung unless in the query).

**Instructions:**
Return ONLY a JSON object with two fields:
- "expansions": An array of exactly {n} strings.
- "context_terms": An array of up to 5 short tokens/phrases capturing relevant biological context.
"""

DISAMBIGUATION_PROMPT = """
You are a meticulous biomedical ontology curator. Your sole task is to choose the single best ontology term from the candidates that STRICTLY matches the query and its context.

**INPUT:**
- Query: "{query}"
- Field: "{field_name}"
- Tissue Context: "{tissue}"

**CANDIDATES (ID | Label | Source | Score | Description):**
{candidates_block}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
You MUST return a candidate ID from the list below. If NO candidate satisfies all rules after applying constraints, set "chosen_id": null.

{disambiguation_rules}
- Context enforcement: If a Tissue Context is provided, REJECT any candidate whose label/definition/synonyms indicate an incompatible organ/system (e.g., salivary or mammary ducts for lung; non-respiratory tissues for airway queries).
- Species enforcement: REJECT candidates with species markers (e.g., "(Mmus)") that contradict the organism context.
- Unknown/ambiguous queries: For queries containing "unknown" or "doublet", prefer to set "chosen_id": null rather than guess.
- The retrieval score is the LEAST important factor; use it only to break ties between candidates that already satisfy all rules and context constraints.

**ABSTAIN CAPABILITY:**
If no candidate satisfies all rules and constraints, set "chosen_id": null to abstain rather than making an incorrect choice.

**FINAL SELECTION:**
Evaluate the candidates against the rules above and select the single best match, or abstain if none qualify.

Return ONLY a JSON object with these fields:
- "chosen_id": The single best candidate ID that satisfies all rules, OR null to abstain.
- "reason": A brief, expert rationale explaining WHY the chosen candidate is correct (or why you abstained).
- "llm_confidence": A number in [0,1] indicating your confidence.

"""Prompt templates used by the expansion and disambiguation LLMs.

  - {tissue}: dataset tissue context (may be "N/A")

# Context-only prompt for deriving short, high-signal disambiguation hints
CONTEXT_TERMS_PROMPT = """
List 3-5 short, domain-specific context terms to help disambiguate the query for ontology linking.

Input:
- Query: "{query}"
- Field: "{field_name}"
- Tissue: "{tissue}"
- Organism: "{organism}"

Rules:
- Return concise tokens/phrases (1-3 words), no punctuation or explanations.
- Prefer high-signal biological hints (e.g., anatomical subregions, lineage, markers, qualifiers).
- Do not include the original query tokens; avoid duplicates and overly generic words.

Return ONLY JSON:
